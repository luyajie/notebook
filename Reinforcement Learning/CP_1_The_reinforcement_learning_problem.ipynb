    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning problems involve learning what to do — how to map situations to actions — so as to maximize a numerical reword signal. In an essential way these are closed-loop problems because the learning system’s actions influence its later inputs.\n",

    "A **policy** is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy is the core of a reinforcement learning agent in the sense that it alone is sufficient to determine behavior. In general, policies may be stochastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **reward signal** defines the goal in a reinforcement learning problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "On each time step, the environment sends to the reinforcement learning agent a single number, a reward. The agent’s sole objective is to maximize the total reward it receives over the long run. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **value function** specifies what is good *in the long run*.\n",
    "\n",
    "the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state."
