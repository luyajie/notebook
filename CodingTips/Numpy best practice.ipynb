    "## 1. Why numpy? Python is \"slow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple reason is that Python a dynamically typed, interpreted language, where values are stored not in dense buffers but in scattered objects. So every thing in python is an object, even premitive types such as `int` or `float`. The objects in a list un-orderly stored in the memory... So it is reasonable that Python is slow. However, Pyhon is fast in terms of pototyping everything. In addtion, Python can easily call other compiled-type library to boost up! `Numpy` is one of the choice to boost up the code specified for matrix calculation. In this case, you get both fast developing and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why `Numpy` is fast? Or why the array in numpy is faster than python list object? Here is a good explaination from reference 2.\n",
