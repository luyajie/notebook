    "### Event streams are ordered\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an inherent notion of which events occur before or after other events.\n",
    "This is clearest when looking at financial events. A sequence in which I first put\n",
    "money in my account and later spend the money is very different from a\n",
    "sequence at which I first spend the money and later cover my debt by depositing\n",
    "money back. The latter will incur overdraft charges while the former will not.\n",
    "Note that this is one of the differences between an event stream and a database\n",
    "table—records in a table are always considered unordered and the “order by”\n",

    "chandise to a shop, we don’t delete the fact that the merchandise was sold to him\n",
    "earlier, rather we record the return as an additional event. This is another differ‐\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a desirable property. While it is easy to imagine nonreplayable streams\n",
    "(TCP packets streaming through a socket are generally nonreplayable), for most\n",
    "business applications, it is critical to be able to replay a raw stream of events that\n",
    "occured months (and sometimes years) earlier. This is required in order to cor‐\n",
    "rect errors, try new methods of analysis, or perform audits. This is the reason we\n",

    "allows capturing and replaying a stream of events. Without this capability, stream\n",
    "processing would not be more than a lab toy for data scientists.\n",

    "## What is stream processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream processing is a programming paradigm just like request-response and batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Request-response\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the lowest latency paradigm, with response times ranging from submilli‐\n",
    "seconds to a few milliseconds, usually with the expectation that response times\n",
    "will be highly consistent. The mode of processing is usually blocking—an app\n",
    "sends a request and waits for the processing system to respond. In the database\n",
    "world, this paradigm is known as online transaction processing (OLTP). Point-of-\n",
    "sale systems, credit card processing, and time-tracking systems typically work in\n",
    "this paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the high-latency/high-throughput option. The processing system wakes\n",
    "up at set times—every day at 2:00 A.M., every hour on the hour, etc. It reads all\n",
    "required input (either all data available since last execution, all data from begin‐\n",
    "ning of month, etc.), writes all required output, and goes away until the next time\n",
    "it is scheduled to run. Processing times range from minutes to hours and users\n",
    "expect to read stale data when they are looking at results. In the database world,\n",
    "these are the data warehouse and business intelligence systems—data is loaded in\n",
    "huge batches once a day, reports are generated, and users look at the same reports\n",
    "until the next data load occurs. This paradigm often has great efficiency and\n",
    "economy of scale, but in recent years, businesses need the data available in\n",
    "shorter timeframes in order to make decision-making more timely and efficient.\n",
    "This puts huge pressure on systems that were written to exploit economy of scale\n",
    "—not to provide low-latency reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stream processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a contentious and nonblocking option. Filling the gap between the\n",
    "request-response world where we wait for events that take two milliseconds to\n",
    "process and the batch processing world where data is processed once a day and\n",
    "takes eight hours to complete. Most business processes don’t require an immedi‐\n",
